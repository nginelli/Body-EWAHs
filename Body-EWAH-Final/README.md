# Websocket Unity VFX Graph
This project is built using Websockets and Unity. It uses each client to control game objects in the unity scene. Those game objects in turn control a particle system. This was meant to be a collaborative interactive visual and hopefully could be used in a large scal context with multiple users. It uses each client to control game objects in the Unity scene. Those game objects in turn control a VFX Graph particle system. Imagined as a collaborative interactive visual game, this prototype could later be used in a large scale context with multiple users, using motion tracking and more embodied interactions. 

Inspired by collaborative drawing programs and a desire to make a novel type of multi-user real-time 3D sculpture.
