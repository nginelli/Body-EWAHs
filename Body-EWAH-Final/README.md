# Websocket Unity VFX Graph
This app is built as part of a two-part final involving Websockets and Unity. It uses each client to control game objects in the Unity scene. Those game objects in turn control a VFX Graph particle system. Imagined as a collaborative interactive visual game, this prototype could later be used in a large scale context with multiple users.

Inspired by collaborative drawing programs and a desire to make a novel type of multi-user real-time 3D sculpture.
